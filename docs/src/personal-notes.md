# Cross platform software

- Act: https://github.com/nektos/act, this one cannot be compiled succesfully despite providing for windows, packages ????, there is alos thisissue [here](https://github.com/nektos/act/issues/1608) despite them providing windows distribution, why dont people care about cross platform of software
 it tries to copy /usr/local/bin/act despite being the windows system, 
 the documentation around this is also very poor, no mention of support for different platforms
